# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: "hello, world!"

This is the first application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

This is a simple Ruby on Rails application that prints `Hello, World` on the browser.

In order to make it run, clone this repo by typing
```
$ git clone https://github.com/marcosfparreiras/rails_hello_app.git
```
Then, in the terminal type
```
$ cd /path/to/repo
$ rails server
```
Thus just open your favorite browser and access http://localhost:3000 and you'll see the `Hello, World` message.

This app has been deployed to Heroku and can be accessed also accessing https://mfp-rails-hello.herokuapp.com/.
